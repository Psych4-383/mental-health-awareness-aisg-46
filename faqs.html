                    Q1- What exactly is mental health?
                </h3>
                <p class="answer">
                    Mental health is our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel,
                    and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, related to others, and make choices. Mental
                    health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.

                    Q2- Why is mental health awareness important?
                </h3>
                <p class="answer">
                    Mental health awareness increases the chances for early intervention, which can result in a fast
                    recovery. Awareness reduces negative adjectives that have been set to describe our people with a
                    metal illness. Carelessness in maintaining mental health can lead to many disorders. By raising
                    awareness, mental health can now be seen as an illness. These illnesses can be managed by treatment.
                    Recently, Simone Biles, an American gymnast recently withdrew from Tokyo Olympics due to some mental
                    health problems. She was ranked number one in women’s gymnastics and was an expected winner
                    statistically.

                    Q3- What should be done to promote mental health awareness?
                </h3>
                <p class="answer">
                    It is critical that we start conversations about what mental illness is, how to recognize it and the
                    fact that it is a treatable illness. Here are some simple steps you can take to help raise the
                    collective consciousness about mental health where you live: <br><br>
                    Talk with everyone you know- Ask family, friends, and coworkers how they are doing and really listen
                    to the answers. <br><br>
                    Open about your experience- If you have struggled or are struggling with mental illness, share your
                    story. <br><br>
                    Educate yourself about mental illness- It is common for people to misunderstand mental illness.
                    Learn more about it and share what you learn.
                    Volunteer- Mental health organizations frequently need help with specific initiatives and ongoing
                    efforts. <br><br>
                    Encourage physical health that supports mental health- Help people understand that physical health
                    can have a direct impact on mental health. Eating healthy and getting plenty of exercise and sleep
                    all play a part in a person’s mental and emotional state. <br> <br>
