            Pandemics are stressful situations for people and communities. Fear and anxiety with a lack of knowledge
            about the disease often leads to social stigma.
            COVID-19 pandemic altered the way of living, making a drastic change in the lives of the people. Schools and
            universities closed, exams and events got postponed, the usual health information services were limited,
            socializing with friends and a wider family was highly discouraged and, in some places, punishable. The
            sense of uncertainty and helplessness consumed them beyond control. People lost their jobs, friends, and
            family members. Living in these circumstances was tough for these people and had a significant impact on
            mental health.
        </p>
        <p class="para" id="second-para">
            Most of the people feared contracting COVID-19 to themselves or their relatives. Many children and parents
            indicated COVID-19 being the main factor affecting their emotions. Children were anxious about school
            closures, interrupted access to basic services and their families’ economic hardships due to COVID-19
            containment measures.
            Many parents reported changes in how their children spend their days in the community since the start of the
            pandemic. Many noticed changes in their relationships with their children, including children’s aggressive
            behavior, and stress and pressure on both children and parents.
        </p>
        <p class="para" id="third-para">
            Children also identified family poverty and food insecurity as a chief concern. For children in poor or
            displaced families, job losses placed them at grave risk of food insecurity resulting in violations of their
            rights and protections. This in turn contributes to their increased sense of helplessness and stress too.
            Bereavement, isolation, loss of income and fear triggered many people’s mental health conditions. Many
            people faced depression, anxiety, and insomnia during these tough times.
